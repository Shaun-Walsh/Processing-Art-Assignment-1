Overall mark
** DONâ€™T FORGET TO TOTAL UP OR WE WILL TOO ** 3+2+5+6+20+16+5+6+6+3+5 = 77

This will be multiplied by a mark out of 10 for complexity of the problem you tackled. E.g. 10/10 = *1

This will be multiplied by a mark out of 10 for interview. 10/10 * 1

*** Constraints ***
Ignoring the constraints results in the equivalent of scoring 3/10 = .3 for interview
