Art is subjective, while I believe I have created a basic looking piece of art others may find it very visually appealing.
I enjoy the transition between the colours on the frame and how it follows the vaporwave theme.
I feel the main artistic value of this project is in how it encourages user interactivity within the sketch itself through mouse and keyboard methods
which creates a unique piece of art of upon every interaction from the user.
